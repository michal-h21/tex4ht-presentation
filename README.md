# Presentation Template Repository

This repository provides a structured LaTeX template for preparing presentations, handouts, and full-text documentation from a single source.

This template is designed for presentations that need more than just slides. It
lets you create both the talk itself and a more detailed handout with notes and
commentary. That way, you can generate everything from a single source—both the
material for the live talk and something meaningful for people who didn’t
attend.


## Documentation

You can find the documentation and usage examples [here](https://www.kodymirus.cz/tex4ht-presentation/).


## License

Feel free to reuse or adapt this template for your own presentations.
